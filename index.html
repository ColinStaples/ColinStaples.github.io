  <h1> Welcome to Colin's CSC 106 Website </h1> 
    <h2> Basic Website Information> 
      <p> This website was created to share all projects and content created in the University of Rhode Island's CSC 106 course.  The Joy of Programming, better known as CSC 106, <br> 
        is an introductory programming course where students, like myself, learn to program websites, games, and other applications.  I plan to use this website to share my work <br> 
        with future employers, family, and friends.  Personally, I believe that it will be a great way to track my progress throughout the semester, and as I move on to other <br> 
        computer science courses as I complete the minor. </p> 
      
      <p> As you explore this site, you will notice that it is broken into three sections.  These sections include a "Home" page, "Javascripts" page, and an "About Me" page. <br> 
        Each web page includes a banner, title, navigation buttons, headline, and a descriptive paragraph.  The "Home" page displays the overview of the website, and what the <br> 
        viewer can expect to see on the other web pages.  On the "Javascripts" page, you will find projects completed throughout the semester using this programming language. <br> 
        For those who are not familiar with javascripts, relative key word and defintions will be provided to better your understanding of the topic. Last but not least, the <br> 
        "About Me" page is all about the creator. </p> 
      
     <p> It is my hope that you enjoy this website as much as I enjoyed creating it, and possibly find some inspiration to learn more about computer programming. Thank you for taking <br> 
       the time to view my work! </p>
