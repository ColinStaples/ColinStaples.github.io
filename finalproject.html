      <h1> <strong> Colin's CSC 106 Final Project </strong> </h1> 
      <h2> How well do you know Supply Chain Management? </h2> 
     
     <p> As a Supply Chain Management major at the University of Rhode Island, I was influenced to create an educational app that will help students, such as myself, prepare for their 
       final exam in the BUS 255 (Operations & Supply Chain Management) course. This application begins with a splash screen, including my bitmoji and start button, where the user will 
       click on the "start" button to begin studying for BUS 255.  After beginning the educational app, the user will interact with three different scenes.  Due to the fact that this app 
       was designed for students studying for their BUS 255 final, the scenes will ask an important question from chapters 10-12 of the textbook.  In each scene, the user will be presented
       with three possible answer options, where they will then have to select the correct answer to the question.  After a question has been correctly answered, the user will advance to the
       next scene.  
      </p> 
      
      <p> As a student learning coding, I wanted to use what I have learned in URI's CSC 106 - The Joy of Programming course to make a spin-off of Quizlet.  I hope that you use this app to 
        improve your knowledge of Supply Chain Management; an industry that is growing rapidly.  In fact, Supply Chain Management is an important aspect of every business today.  </p>
